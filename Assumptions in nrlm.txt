Assumptions for models.py:

1) In class progress and targets, the column name that starts with a number (e.g. Two_1 starts with number 2) maps to the questions asked in the forms. Example column Two_1 refers to question 2.1 i.e. Total number of blocks in which intensive strategy implementation is in progress.

2) In class HrDetails, the column name that starts with word "Col" (e.g Col2_smmu) represents the column number in the form. Example, Col_2 represent column (ii) i.e. No. of units setup that are approved.

3) In class FinancialAssistance, the column name that starts with word "Col" represents a column in form. Ex. Col2_SC represents "Total no. of SHGs (For SCs)"
